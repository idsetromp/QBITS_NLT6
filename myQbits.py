# This script creates two qbits,
# applies a couple of gates to them,
# and finally displays both qbits on the bloch sphere.

# Creating the two qbits.
q0 = qbit()
q1 = qbit()

# Applying the gates.
gate(Rx(45, angleUnit='degree'), q0) # Here, we want to rotate q0 45Â°.
				     # Therefore, `angleUnit` is set to 'degree'.
				     # The standard angleUnit is radians.
gate(T_dagger, q1)

gate(CNOT, q0, q1)

gate(Hadamard, q0)

# Finally, the two qbits are displayed on the bloch sphere.
GPU.drawBlochSphere([q0, q1])
