# Introduction

The library is made up of two important components: the QPU and de GPU.
The QPU (Quantum Processing Unit) is used for all qbit-related stuff. E.g. quantum gates and measuring.
The GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) is used for all, you guessed it, graphical stuff.
Namely, displaying Bloch spheres and graphing measurement results.
To use this library, create a .py file in the parent directory of `src/` (`src/` is the directory which contains QPU.py and GPU.py). This can be done automatically by using [Quantum shell script](#quantum-shell-script). 

# Quantum shell script

With the shell script file named 'quantum', a new python file can be created with the right packages included and an example program in order to get started on using this python package. When this package has been downloaded, open a UNIX terminal (just the terminal on Linux or Mac, or LSW (Linux Subsystem for Windows) on Windows) and change your working directory to the directory of this package. Then, the 'quantum' shell script must be made executable, this can be done by running the following command in the directory of this package:

``` bash
$ chmod u+x quantum
```

A new python file can be created with the following command:

``` bash
$ ./quantum myFile
```

Here, 'myFile' can be substituted for any name you like. In the directory of this package, you will then find myFile.py. This is just a normal python file containing an example program in order to show you how to use this package. There a two example programs, one showcasing the use of measurement graphs (see [Measurement Graph](#measurement-graph)), and one showcasing the use of bloch spheres (see [Bloch Sphere](#bloch-sphere)). Which example program you get, is chosen at random when running the 'quantum' shell script.

# QPU
The QPU is the 'brain' of this library. Al the calculations, superpositions, entanglements and gates are done in the QPU. Make sure to import QPU.py in order to use it. This can be done with the following line of code:

`from src.QPU import *`

## Classes

### qbit

``` python
class qbit
    def __init__(self, vector: np.matrix = np.matrix([[1.+0j], [0.+0j]])):
        ...
```

The qbit class. To create a qbit, use the [prep](#prep) function.

#### Attributes

---

**vector:** *np.matrix with the shape $m\times1$*

The vector of the qbit which defines the wave function $|\psi\rangle$ of the qbit.
If left unspecified when making a qbit object, the vector will be
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \equiv 1|0\rangle + 0|1\rangle = |0\rangle$
which is a qbit orientated in the $+z$ direction ($|0\rangle$). See [Bloch Sphere](#bloch-sphere).

The standard shape of this vector is $2\times1$
($\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix} \equiv \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$),
but when entangled with another qbit, the vector of both qbits will be
$4\times1 \ (\begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma \\ \delta \end{bmatrix} \equiv \alpha|00\rangle + \beta|01\rangle + \gamma|10\rangle + \delta|11\rangle)$.

Do note that
$\Vert\psi\Vert \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} 1$.
Therefore, $\sqrt{\alpha^2+\beta^2} = 1$.
When using de built-in quantum gates this will always be true.
However, when the user manually sets the qbit's vector,
the length of the vector must equal to $1$.
This can be done as follows:
`q[0].vector = np.matrix([[a], [b]])`, where `q[0]` is an object of `qbit` (made using [prep](#prep)), and `a` and `b` are chosen floats which may be complex numbers. Note that the imaginary unit $i$ is denoted in python by `j` placed directly after any number (e.g. `.5 + 1.0j` = $0.5+i$).

---

**entangledQbit:** *qbit*

When two qbit objects get entangled, of the attribute `entangledQbit` of both objects is set to the same list containing the two `qbit` objects.

## Functions

### prep

``` python
def prep(qbit: qbit, Print=True):
    ...
```

This function creates a new qbit and prints "Prepped a new qbit: q\[n]" in the terminal. Here, n is the 'index' of the qbit. The first qbit created will be q\[0], the second q\[1] and so on. q\[n] is an object of the [qbit](#qbit) class. The message printed to the terminal is ony printed is the attribute `Print` is set to `True`. If set to `False`, nothing is printed. When left unspecified,the default is `True`.

### measure

``` python
measure(q: qbit) -> str
```

Measures the qbit and returns the measured state, e.g. '|0>' or '|10>'.
When a qbit is measured, its wave function collapses. This means that, regardless of entanglement or superposition, the qbit is set to either '|0>' or '|1>'.

#### Parameters

---
**q:** *qbit*

The qbit which is measured. After measurement, the wave function of the qbit collapses. This is mathematically denoted as follows:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |\phi_i\rangle \rightarrow |\psi'\rangle = |\phi_i\rangle$$

E.g. a qbit denoted by $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{2}|0\rangle + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt3|1\rangle$ can collapse to either $|\psi\rangle = |0\rangle$ or $|\psi\rangle = |1\rangle$. Which one, is determined by chance based on the coefficients squared of the states. In this case, there is a chance of $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = 0.25$ that $\psi$ collapses to $|0\rangle$, and a chance of $\left(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt3\right)$ that $\psi$ collapses to $|1\rangle$.

When `q` is set to an entangled qbit, the wave function of both qbits collapses to either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$..

### gate

``` python
gate(type: Gate, q0: qbit, q1: qbit = None) -> None
```

Applies a gate to qbit(s). Note that entanglement of more than two qbits is not well built in. This can thus lead to unexpected and wrong results.

#### Parameters

---
**type:** *Gate*

Requires an object of the `Gate` class (see [Gate](#gate)). This gate will be applied to the qbit. This is done by multiplying the matrix of the gate with the qbit's vector. See the example below of a Hadamard gate applied to a qbit orientated in the $|0\rangle$ direction:

$$H\left(|\psi\rangle\right) = H\left(|0\rangle\right) \equiv \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt2} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt2} \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \end{bmatrix} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt2}|0\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt2}|1\rangle$$

---
**q0:** *qbit*

The qbit the gate will be applied to.

---
**q1:** *qbit, standard value is `None`*

If `type` is set to a gate which requires two qbits, like CNOT, `q0` will be the control and `q1` the target qbit. If, however, the gate `type` is set to requires just one qbit, `q1` is must be left empty.

When a gate requiring two qbits is applied, `q0` and `q1` get entangled. See below the example of a CNOT being applied to two qbits:

$$\begin{align*}
    &|\psi\rangle_{A} = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \\
    &|\phi\rangle_{B} = \gamma|0\rangle + \delta|1\rangle \\
    & \\
    &\begin{align*}
        |\psi\rangle_{AB} & = |\psi\rangle_A \otimes |\phi\rangle_B \\
        & = \alpha\gamma|00\rangle + \alpha\delta|01\rangle + \beta\gamma|10\rangle + \beta\delta|11\rangle \\
    \end{align*} \\
    & \\
    &\begin{align*}
        CNOT(|\psi\rangle_{AB}) & = CNOT(\alpha\gamma|00\rangle + \alpha\delta|01\rangle + \beta\gamma|10\rangle + \beta\delta|11\rangle) \\
        & \equiv \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&0&1\\0&0&1&0\end{bmatrix}}_{CNOT} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}\alpha\gamma \\ \alpha\delta \\ \beta\gamma \\ \beta\delta\end{bmatrix} \\
        & = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha\gamma \\ \alpha\delta \\ \beta\delta \\ \beta\gamma \end{bmatrix} \\
        & \equiv \frac{1}{4}\sqrt3|00\rangle + \frac{3}{4}|01\rangle + \frac{1}{4}\sqrt3|10\rangle + \frac{1}{4}|11\rangle
        \end{align*} \\
\end{align*}$$

## Built-in Gates

Most built-in gates are objects of the `Gate` class. To apply a built-in gate to a `qbit` object, the `gate` function can be used (see [gate](#gate-1)). Every gate has a matrix, and a certain amount of qbits the gate can be applied to (e.g. Hadamard can be applied to one qbit, CNOT to two). A few gates are 'variable' gates, like Rx. These gates are built in as function.

### Hadamard
*The Hadamard gate is a single-qubit operation that maps the basis state $|0\rangle$ to $\frac{|0\rangle + |1\rangle}{\sqrt2}$ and $|1\rangle$ to $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt2}$â€‹, thus creating an equal superposition of the two basis states.*

### CNOT

*The CNOT gate is two-qubit operation, where the first qubit is usually referred to as the control qubit and the second qubit as the target qubit. Expressed in basis states, the CNOT gate:*

- *leaves the target qubit unchanged when the control qubit is in state $|0\rangle$.*

### CZ

*The Controlled-Z (CZ) gate is a two-qubit gate used in quantum computing. It operates on a pair of qubits, with one qubit acting as the control and the other as the target. In layman's terms, the CZ gate applies a phase flip (change in the relative phase) to the target qubit only when the control qubit is in the state $|1\rangle$. If the control qubit is in the state $|0\rangle$, the CZ gate does not affect the target qubit.*

```
`theta` is the angle a qbit $\psi$ rotates around the x-axis when Rx is applied to $\psi$ using the `gate()` function (see [gate](#gate-1)). The standard unit of `theta` is radians, however, by setting the parameter `angleUnit` to `'degree'`, this can be changed. This function returns a `Gate` object with the following attributes:

# GPU
The GPU is responsible for all graphics. Both a graph of measured states and Bloch spheres can be rendered. In order to use the GPU, make sure to import it. This can be done with the following line of code:

`from src import GPU`

An alternative would be `from src.GPU import *`. However, to make a clear distinction between what is part of the QPU and GPU, `from src import GPU` is used. The latter requires all the GPU commands to be prefixed by `GPU.`, which distinguishes them from the QPU commands.

## Bloch Sphere
A bloch sphere is a visual representation of an unentangled qbit.

``` python
def drawBlochSphere(qbits: list[src.QPU.qbit], sphereType='grid'):
    ...
```

At any point, the bloch sphere of a qbit can be rendered with the command `GPU.drawBlochSphere(q)`. Here, `q` is a list of qbit objects (e.g. `[q[0], q[2]]`). It is possible to choose between a 'grid' or an 'axis-lines' look, by setting the attribute `sphereType` to either one of the two. If left unspecified, the standard is 'grid'.

!['grid'](/src/assets/grid.png "'grid' example image")

!['axis-lines'](/src/assets/axis-lines.png "'axis-lines' example image")

## Measurement Graph
``` python
def drawGraph(measurements: list[str]):
    ...
```

Graphs the amount of times every state in the list `measurements` appears. Render this graph with the command `GPU.drawGraph(m)`, where `m` is a list filled with the outputs of the [measure](#measure) function.
